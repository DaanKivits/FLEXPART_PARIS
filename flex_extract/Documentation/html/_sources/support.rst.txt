Ticket system
-------------
.. _ticket system: https://www.flexpart.eu/report/1

The community website https://flexpart.eu/ contains a 
`ticket system`_ which can be used to report any issue or to propose new features.

The tickets can be viewed by anyone, to create a ticket a registration is necessary. Since the automatic registration is unavailable, please send an email to the ``flexpart.eu[at]zamg.ac.at`` and you will receive your credentials (possibly with some delay).  Event though a category "Support" is available, in most cases asking questions in the mailing list (see next paragraph below) will be more appropriate.


.. _ref-mailing-list:

Mailing list
------------

A mailing list exists for the ``FLEXPART`` users to ask questions or share experiences with the community, regarding the whole ``FLEXPART`` process. This may be faster than asking only the developers for help through tickets. Since ``flex_extract`` is a preprocessor to ``FLEXPART`` this is the right place to ask for help.

New release versions of ``FLEXPART`` or ``flex_extract`` or other important annoucements will also be made through this mailling list.
The subscription process is explained at the bottom of https://www.flexpart.eu/wiki/RegisteredUser. Once subscribed, write e-mail to ``flexpart[at]lists.univie.ac.at`` to post to the list.
