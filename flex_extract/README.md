# flex_extract

`flex_extract` is a software package to support retrieving meteorological fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System (MARS) as input for the `FLEXTRA`/`FLEXPART` Atmospheric Transport Modelling system.

`FLEXPART` (“FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model”, http://flexpart.eu) is a Lagrangian transport and dispersion model suitable for the simulation of a large range of atmospheric transport processes.
