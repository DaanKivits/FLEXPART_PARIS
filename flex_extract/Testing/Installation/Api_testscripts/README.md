# API test scripts

These example scripts were prepared to test the two APIs "CDS API" and "ECMWF Web API" after their installation for both, member-state users and public users.

They were taken from the official journal publication from Section A2 "System prerequisites".

Execute the scripts and wait for the retrieval to finish and look for the final GRIB file in the directory where the script was executed.
